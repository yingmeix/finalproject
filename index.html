            <p class="timeline__content-desc">In the 1980s, it was a spring of brilliant industry, a spring of fruitful agriculture, a spring of science, a spring of contending a hundred schools of thought, and a spring of literary and artistic blooming. It is an age of fireworks and poetry, an age of openness, tolerance, and sentiment, and an age of free and unrestrained ideas. At that time, popular music began to sing in the streets and alleys, and people would collect the tapes of their favorite singers and listen to them on a tape recorder in a leisurely afternoon.</p >

            <p class="timeline__content-desc">The 1990 people's ideology in the 1990s began to show the combination of Chinese and Western. This is an era when music masters come forth in large numbers and stars are shining. Part of contemporary so-called pop music originated in the West, passed through Taiwan and Hong Kong, and eventually developed inland. The music works of the 1990s have a common feature, that is, they pay attention to the wording and making sentences in the lyrics, and the melody is relatively beautiful, giving people a feeling of immersion.</p >
