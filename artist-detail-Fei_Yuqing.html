            Fei's career began in 1973, and he began to build a large fan base along with his brother. 
			He performed several theme songs for television shows, some of which were more successful than the shows themselves. 
			He has sung numerous hits such as "Yi Jian Mei" (A Trim of Plum Blossoms), "Ode to the Republic of China", and "Good Night Song", which was composed by the Taiwanese songwriter Liu Chia-chang.
