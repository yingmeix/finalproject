            Wakin Chau was born in a rice store owned by his family at Sai Ying Pun in Hong Kong, the fourth son of seven children. 
			He began learning the guitar when he was about 13 years old. 
			In 1979, he left for Taipei to major in mathematics at National Taiwan University. 
			While at college he sang and played folk songs in local coffee shops, learning to sing in Mandarin.
        </p>
        <p class="artist-detail">
            Hoping to establish a career as a recording artist, Chau sought contacts in the music industry, but after a lack of success, eventually signed on as an assistant producer at Rock Records, where he wrote pop songs for other artists. 
			He was later encouraged by Chyi Yu to perform jingles for commercial advertisements. 
			One of his jingles for a car commercial was heard by his boss at Rock, who recognised his voice, and gave him a chance to record a Mandarin album, released on Rock Records in 1987.
        </p>
		<p class="artist-detail">
			From 1985, under the name Emil Chau, he has released more than 40 albums in Mandarin, Cantonese and English. 
			His platinum albums, including You Make Me Happy and Sad, The Flowery Heart, Music Brings Us Together, and Emil & Friends have won awards in Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore. 
			Chau reverted to using his given name Wakin in 1999.
			Chau formed the four-member supergroup Superband, along with Jonathan Lee, Chang Chen-yue, and Lo Ta-yu. 
			They disbanded and resumed their solo careers in 2010.
