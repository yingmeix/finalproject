            Teng was born to a poor family in Baozhong Township, Yunlin County, Taiwan on 29 January 1953, to Waishengren parents. 
            Her father was a soldier in the Republic of China Armed Forces from Daming, Hebei, and her mother was from Dongping, Shandong. 
            The only daughter in the family, with three older brothers and a younger brother, she was educated at Luzhou Elementary School in Luzhou District, Taipei County and then Ginling Girls High School (私立金陵女中) in Sanchong Township, Taipei County, Taiwan.
            Teng's talent for music was discovered at age three. According to her brother, their father's friend, an erhu (Chinese two-stringed violin) player, often visited and complimented Teresa's clear, soft, yet powerful voice. 
            This family friend became Teng's first voice teacher and was instrumental in fostering a passion for music in the girl. 
            Teng's perfect pitch and her amiable demeanor won the hearts of judges in various singing competitions.
            Her first major prize was in 1964 when she sang "Visiting Yingtai" from Shaw Brothers' Huangmei opera movie, The Love Eterne, at an event hosted by Broadcasting Corporation of China.
            She was soon able to support her family with her singing. With her father's approval, she quit school to pursue singing professionally.

            In 1971, Teresa met her first boyfriend, Lin Zhenfa, a Malaysian paper tycoon. Lin liked Teng's music very much, often accompanying her to snack at night and write poems for her. Within a few years, they fell in love. 
            In 1976, Lin died of a heart attack. Later Teresa recorded the song "Goodbye, My Love," dedicated to her boyfriend who had just died.
            In 1980, while auditing classes at UCLA after her deportation from Japan, Teng met Jackie Chan, who was filming in Hollywood; however, due to their personality differences, they parted ways but remained friends.
            In 1981, Teng met Beau Kuok, a Malaysian businessman and son of multi-billionaire Robert Kuok. 
            They were engaged in 1982, but Teng called off the engagement due to prenuptial agreements which stipulated that she had to quit and sever all ties with the entertainment industry, as well as fully disclose her biography and all her past relationships in writing. 
            Teresa was still willing to accept the second and third conditions, only to keep the chance to release her own records. However, the Guo family declined her request, and the marriage was canceled.
            In 1990, Teng met French photographer Paul Quilery in France. They dated 5 years and got engaged a month before Teng's passing away in May 1995.
