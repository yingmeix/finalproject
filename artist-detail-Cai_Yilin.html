			She is known for her continual reinvention and versatility in music style and visual image, and she has achieved great reputation and popularity in the Chinese-speaking world. 
			She is also regarded as one of the key popularizers of dance-pop as mainstream music in Greater China, and she remains completely in charge of every aspect of her career.

        </p>
		<p class="artist-detail">
			In 1998, Tsai won the champion at a television singing competition show produced by MTV Mandarin.
			In 1999, she released her debut album, 1019. The album was an instant hit, and her first incarnation of the girl next door made her become a teen idol with a huge teenage fan base.
			In 2003, she released her fifth studio album Magic, which reflected her first musical reinvention and marked the beginning of her dance-oriented musical direction.
			In 2006, she released her eighth studio album Dancing Diva, whose slick dance songs and dazzling dance moves established her representative status as a dance-pop artist in the C-pop music industry.
		</p>
		<p class="artist-detail">
			In 2009, Tsai founded the company Eternal and started to be completely in charge of her career.
			In 2010, she released her eleventh studio album Myself, considered one of the most experimental albums in the C-pop music industry. 
			In 2012, she released her twelfth studio album Muse, which integrated pop music and pop art and spanned mainstream and independent music.

        <p class="artist-detail">
			Tsai has sold more than 25 million albums in Asia, and is recognized as one of the best-selling artist in Asia.
			Due to the adverse impact from the copyright infringement and Internet downloads in Greater China since the 2000s, Chinese recording artists have experienced losses and decrease in sales. 
			However, since her album Magic (2003), each of her studio albums at least became the best-selling album by a female artist of the year in Taiwan. Three albums—Dancing Diva (2006), Agent J (2007), and Butterfly (2009)—each even became the best-selling album of the year in Taiwan. 
			Tsai has 39 songs listed on the Hit FM Top 100 Singles of the Year, the Taiwan's equivalent to the Billboard Year-End Hot 100. With five songs—"Marry Me Today", "Sun Will Never Set", "Honey Trap", "Play", and "Ugly Beauty"—topping the chart, she became the singer with the most number-one songs on the chart.
			Tsai has been honored with numerous awards and nominations domestically and internationally, including an MTV Video Music Award for International Viewer's Choice, an MTV Asia Award for the Style Award, an Mnet Asian Music Award for Best Asian Artist. She has also won seven Golden Melody Awards, the most equivalent to the Grammy Awards in Greater China, and made her the dance-pop singer with the most Golden Melody Award trophies received.
			In 2016, her album Play set the record for the most Golden Melody Awards nominations (ten nominations), leading to a tie with Taiwanese singers Jay Chou's Fantasy (2001) and A-Mei's Amit (2009).
