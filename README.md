# CM523 Project Starter

You may use this repo as a 'starter' kit for your project. In it you will find...
- the homepage (index.html) boilerplate with comments/annotations
- a styles directory that includes the `normalize.css` reset and your `styles.css` file (write all of your CSS in that file)
- a scripts directory that includes a `scripts.js` file (where you will write your JS) and a vendor directory where you can include external JS libraries
- an images directory (put ALL of your images in this directory)

## A few notes
- index.html is your home page -- it is not home.html or anything else!
- No captial letters or spaces in any file or directory.
- Resize your images to fit the context. For example, if you have an image asset that is 1000px by 500px, but you only use it at 500px by 250px... then resize it to fit. Don't waste bytes. 
- Think critically about your naming conventions. Things like page1.html, page2.html, are typically not helpful. Same with your CSS class names and JS variable/function names.
- Don't throw aside all the lessons you learned this semester... accessibility, green design, atomic design, responsive design, CSS architecture, design systems, typography, layout, color, negative space, etc.
